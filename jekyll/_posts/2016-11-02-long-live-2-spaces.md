title: Long live 2 spaces!
---

Anybody else out there still typing 2 spaces after each piece of punctuation?  

According to <a href='http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/two-spaces-after-a-period'>the venerable Grammer Girl ( episode 465)</a>, 2 spaces is passe.  But even in her own argument, she links to an even _more_ venerable source: <a href='http://www.apastyle.org/manual/whats-new.aspx'>the APA style guide</a>  You know what they say? 

<blockquote>
  return to two spaces after the period at the end of the sentence recommended for ease of reading comprehension
</blockquote> 
 
What's the deal, grammer girl?  After all, as even you say, web browsers are going to combine those spaces.  And that makes sense; worrying about how much whitespace I use is, unless you're <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13884499/what-is-python-whitespace-and-how-does-it-work'>writing python</a> ( also <a href='https://xkcd.com/353/'>this</a>, just for run), for typesetters.  And yet you argue that I should bother <em>not</em> using 2 space after all my punctuation?  

Whatever.  The typesetters can fix it when they're subjected to my textual proclivities.  I'm going to keep doing it.  

Long live 2 spaces!
