Many years ago, it seemed like a good idea to create a bunch of web pages in PHP and then serve them from computers I had to configure, care for and feed.  

It was not.  

I don't have anything interesting to say these days about myself anyway, so what content could I possibly come up with for this site?

So now I'm moving to jekyll  and S3, so I don't have any servers to manage.
